# soc-econ-shiny

Eric Potash's Soil Organic Carbon Economics application, powered by R (Shiny).

Syling refactor changes (CSS, header, three-column layout, About modal) made by Evan Chen. 

R applications expect image assets in a `www` folder, hence funder / collaborator logos (NSF, ARPAE, ffar, ASC) being placed there. Also, `custom.css` is defined in `www` - but note there is also a significant amount of inline CSS changes made to support styling.
